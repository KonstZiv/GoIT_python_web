homework, part 2
This repository contains homework solutions for the second part of the GoIT curriculum. They differ in the complexity and quality of the solution, but there are some interesting ones among them.
the most interesting tasks, in my opinion:

- hw1_metaclasses/abstract_class.py - serialization deserialization to (from) JSON without "data type corruption" during these conversions
- hw4_threads, hw5_processes - used treads and multuprocessing to speed up a previously written sorter. Everything worked out)
- hw6_asunc - used the asyncio module to speed up the file sorter program (from the first part of the course). I enjoyed the solution and the result)
- hw7_sockets - a simple program, but I especially like the result. The basis of a simple messenger has been written - it works in console mode. Both the server and the client work asynchronously (the client also uses threads to avoid blocking while executing an input operation). Everything works, the description in the folder is in the file (). important! the code does not handle a number of possible errors and does not know how to work with broken connections, etc. It wasn't necessary yet.
